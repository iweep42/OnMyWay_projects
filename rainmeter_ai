  I was working on trying to set up an openai that works on a rainmeter widget that can response to your messagess( idk whether it keeps log of the conversation or not).

  Unfortunately, I wasnt been able to complete the task since I am busy on something else. It took me about a hour. 

what I did:

      -  Download the app,

      -  Download the openai,

      -  Setting up api,

              *Though I still have doubts on whether its open or not

        
commentary: I think I was so close to setting it up, with 2 more hours then it should be working.

      What I need to do:

      -  Make the rain meter widget work by first maybe making the widget create response.txt in the desktop without AIs help.

      -  Learning more about how the open ai api works.

Overall, the reflection took about 5 mins, I am still a quite slow writer. This problem will be  esentially minimalized as I write more.

I need a working api key right now.

The design for rainmeter isn't good
